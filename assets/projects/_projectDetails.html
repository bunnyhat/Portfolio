				<h2 class="about">About The Game</h2>
					<h5>
						<p>Dusty Space is a two player 2D space shooter, made in Unity. Players can either compete or cooperate with each other in order defeat incoming waves of UFO ships. Players gain points for each kill but can also lose points for shooting at each other.</p>
						<p>With a simple controls layout, this game can be played on a browser or tablet. Players are allowed to move left and right to dodge oncoming laser beams that the enemies or the opposite player shoots at them.</p>
						<p>Once both players have lost against the waves of enemies, they can see the score they achieved from the number of kills they got.</p>
					</h5>

 				<h2 class="how">How it was made</h2>
					<h5>
						When coming up with ideas on how to make a retro space invaders type game different, I thought to myself, "How can I make this different than what had already been made years ago?". After very little thinking, I decided why not make it 2 players, where players can work together to fight off the invaders. I had looked up sprites and found the perfect match to what I wanted my game to look like. A quick google search on a space background and I had the base assets to get started on my game. Once I got started, I knew I made the ships on opposing sides and wanted the enemies to be in the middle of the screen. First I maped out the players movement then figured out how to make the players shoot. From there, I went on to writing enemy behavior, they would move from one end of the screen, once they hit that side, they would head in the oppositie direction. Then of course, hit detection between the player's laser beams and the enemy's laser beams, and the "KA-BOOMS" were added. While doing collision detection, I asked myself, "What about when a player shoots the other player?!", then what I thought would be a co-op game, became not only a co-op game but also a competetive game. Soon, I added hit detection if players hit each other. Once those basic mechanics where fully polished, I went onto the UI of the game. Grabbed that funky font that suited my space theme and wrote a short script to display a score when players get a kill against the enemies. And deducted points for shooting at the other player. Health was added to the game after that, where as enemies are a one hit kill. A pause and game over UI was implemented. Following that, a simple Game Manager which acts a singleton was added to manage game pauses, player(s) death, sound manager and game over mechanics. To make the sound manager work, I grabbed a few "pew pew", "KA-BOOM" and button click/tap sounds off a free sound website. After a few iterations of polishing, I decided to make the game playable on tablets. In order to do that, buttons were placed on the screen to show where to tap to move left and right and to shoot. Then a few small changes and additions were made to the player movement scripts to detect taps for the approriate buttons.

                <h5>
                    <p>Snakes was a class final project for the Advanced HTML course. It was designed and coded using melonJS. It is like the original Snakes game, but with an added bonus of having 2 player mode.</p>
                    <p>Both players must eat as many pallets to grow in size and trap the other player in order to win. Pallets give points and in the end, the player that wins, then gets a high score of the pallets obtained by both the players.</p>
                    <p>This game can also be played in one player mode, just like the classic one on any browser.</p>

            <h2 class="how">How it was made</h2>
                <h5>
                    When coming up with ideas on how to make a retro space invaders type game different, I thought to myself, "How can I make this different than what had already been made years ago?". After very little thinking, I decided why not make it 2 players, where players can work together to fight off the invaders. I had looked up sprites and found the perfect match to what I wanted my game to look like. A quick google search on a space background and I had the base assets to get started on my game. Once I got started, I knew I made the ships on opposing sides and wanted the enemies to be in the middle of the screen. First I maped out the players movement then figured out how to make the players shoot. From there, I went on to writing enemy behavior, they would move from one end of the screen, once they hit that side, they would head in the oppositie direction. Then of course, hit detection between the player's laser beams and the enemy's laser beams, and the "KA-BOOMS" were added. While doing collision detection, I asked myself, "What about when a player shoots the other player?!", then what I thought would be a co-op game, became not only a co-op game but also a competetive game. Soon, I added hit detection if players hit each other. Once those basic mechanics where fully polished, I went onto the UI of the game. Grabbed that funky font that suited my space theme and wrote a short script to display a score when players get a kill against the enemies. And deducted points for shooting at the other player. Health was added to the game after that, where as enemies are a one hit kill. A pause and game over UI was implemented. Following that, a simple Game Manager which acts a singleton was added to manage game pauses, player(s) death, sound manager and game over mechanics. To make the sound manager work, I grabbed a few "pew pew", "KA-BOOM" and button click/tap sounds off a free sound website. After a few iterations of polishing, I decided to make the game playable on tablets. In order to do that, buttons were placed on the screen to show where to tap to move left and right and to shoot. Then a few small changes and additions were made to the player movement scripts to detect taps for the approriate buttons. Finally, I tested it on my tablet to ensure it was playable from start to end and play tested it with others.

                <h5>
                    <p>Snakes was a class final project for the Advanced HTML course. It was designed and coded using melonJS. It is like the original Snakes game, but with an added bonus of having 2 player mode.</p>
                    <p>Both players must eat as many pallets to grow in size and trap the other player in order to win. Pallets give points and in the end, the player that wins, then gets a high score of the pallets obtained by both the players.</p>
                    <p>This game can also be played in one player mode, just like the classic one on any browser.</p>

            <h2 class="how">How it was made</h2>
                <h5>
                    When coming up with ideas on how to make a retro space invaders type game different, I thought to myself, "How can I make this different than what had already been made years ago?". After very little thinking, I decided why not make it 2 players, where players can work together to fight off the invaders. I had looked up sprites and found the perfect match to what I wanted my game to look like. A quick google search on a space background and I had the base assets to get started on my game. Once I got started, I knew I made the ships on opposing sides and wanted the enemies to be in the middle of the screen. First I maped out the players movement then figured out how to make the players shoot. From there, I went on to writing enemy behavior, they would move from one end of the screen, once they hit that side, they would head in the oppositie direction. Then of course, hit detection between the player's laser beams and the enemy's laser beams, and the "KA-BOOMS" were added. While doing collision detection, I asked myself, "What about when a player shoots the other player?!", then what I thought would be a co-op game, became not only a co-op game but also a competetive game. Soon, I added hit detection if players hit each other. Once those basic mechanics where fully polished, I went onto the UI of the game. Grabbed that funky font that suited my space theme and wrote a short script to display a score when players get a kill against the enemies. And deducted points for shooting at the other player. Health was added to the game after that, where as enemies are a one hit kill. A pause and game over UI was implemented. Following that, a simple Game Manager which acts a singleton was added to manage game pauses, player(s) death, sound manager and game over mechanics. To make the sound manager work, I grabbed a few "pew pew", "KA-BOOM" and button click/tap sounds off a free sound website. After a few iterations of polishing, I decided to make the game playable on tablets. In order to do that, buttons were placed on the screen to show where to tap to move left and right and to shoot. Then a few small changes and additions were made to the player movement scripts to detect taps for the approriate buttons. Finally, I tested it on my tablet to ensure it was playable from start to end and play tested it with others.
