				<h2 class="about">About The Game</h2>
					<h5>
						<p>Dusty Space is a two player 2D space shooter, made in Unity. Players can either compete or cooperate with each other in order defeat incoming waves of UFO ships. Players gain points for each kill but can also lose points for shooting at each other.</p>
						<p>With a simple controls layout, this game can be played on a browser or tablet. Players are allowed to move left and right to dodge oncoming laser beams that the enemies or the opposite player shoots at them.</p>
						<p>Once both players have lost against the waves of enemies, they can see the score they achieved from the number of kills they got.</p>
					</h5>

				<h2 class="features">Features</h2>

 				<h2 class="how">How it was made</h2>
					<h5>
						When coming up with ideas on how to make a retro space invaders type game different, I thought to myself, "How can I make this different than what had already been made years ago?". After very little thinking, I decided why not make it 2 players, where players can work together to fight off the invaders. I had looked up sprites and found the perfect match to what I wanted my game to look like. A quick google search on a space background and I had the base assets to get started on my game. Once I got started, I knew I made the ships on opposing sides and wanted the enemies to be in the middle of the screen. First I maped out the players movement then figured out how to make the players shoot. From there, I went on to writing enemy behavior, they would move from one end of the screen, once they hit that side, they would head in the oppositie direction. Then of course, hit detection between the player's laser beams and the enemy's laser beams, and the "KA-BOOMS" were added. While doing collision detection, I asked myself, "What about when a player shoots the other player?!", then what I thought would be a co-op game, became not only a co-op game but also a competetive game. Soon, I added hit detection if players hit each other. Once those basic mechanics where fully polished, I went onto the UI of the game. Grabbed that funky font that suited my space theme and wrote a short script to display a score when players get a kill against the enemies. And deducted points for shooting at the other player. Health was added to the game after that, where as enemies are a one hit kill. A pause and game over UI was implemented. Following that, a simple Game Manager which acts a singleton was added to manage game pauses, player(s) death, sound manager and game over mechanics. To make the sound manager work, I grabbed a few "pew pew", "KA-BOOM" and button click/tap sounds off a free sound website. After a few iterations of polishing, I decided to make the game playable on tablets. In order to do that, buttons were placed on the screen to show where to tap to move left and right and to shoot. Then a few small changes and additions were made to the player movement scripts to detect taps for the approriate buttons. Finally, I tested it on my tablet to ensure it was playable from start to end and play tested it with others.

						First me and my group members gattered the sprites from Google Images for the hotdog, burger, the toppings, the images for when the toppings are clicked, 
                        and the background. Then we began by creating the mechanincs, one of us worked on making the hotdog or burger appear one at a time randomly, stay for about 6 seconds 
                        then go back up. I worked on making the toppings being responsive when it was tapped. We had 3 toppings the customers can ask for, ketchup, mustard or mayo. 
                        Once that was done, we worked on making the right sprite appear on the burger or hotdog when clicked. Next, we worked on making a timer, and giving money as reward for 
                        tapping on the right topping. When the timer goes down to 0, a GUI menu will come up that will allow players to buy supplies for the next day.

                        tuned the spawner, while I worked on making the player shoot in the 4 directions, depending on where the player was facing and adding a collision box. 
                        Next, we worked on destroying the zombies when a palet which was used as a basic bullet-like object, it should despawn the zombie and add it back to the spawner pool. 
                        Then, an explosion sprite was added and placed where the zombie dies. I worked on creating the map and placing spawners and walls as well as making the touch buttons 
                        appear on-screen so the player knows where the movement buttons are and where the shoot and pause button are. After that, a very basic pause screen was made that gets 
                        enabled when pause button is pressed, and a boolean check happens, if the game is paused and pause button is tapped, then game should un-pause. Once that was done, we 
                        moved on to making the title screen and the game over screen when the player dies, to display the score they earned during that playtime. On the main menu, the highest 
                        achieved score is shown, which is updated if the player manages to beat their high score.

                <h5>
                    <p>Snakes was a class final project for the Advanced HTML course. It was designed and coded using melonJS. It is like the original Snakes game, but with an added bonus of having 2 player mode.</p>
                    <p>Both players must eat as many pallets to grow in size and trap the other player in order to win. Pallets give points and in the end, the player that wins, then gets a high score of the pallets obtained by both the players.</p>
                    <p>This game can also be played in one player mode, just like the classic one on any browser.</p>

            <h2 class="how">How it was made</h2>
                <h5>
                    When coming up with ideas on how to make a retro space invaders type game different, I thought to myself, "How can I make this different than what had already been made years ago?". After very little thinking, I decided why not make it 2 players, where players can work together to fight off the invaders. I had looked up sprites and found the perfect match to what I wanted my game to look like. A quick google search on a space background and I had the base assets to get started on my game. Once I got started, I knew I made the ships on opposing sides and wanted the enemies to be in the middle of the screen. First I maped out the players movement then figured out how to make the players shoot. From there, I went on to writing enemy behavior, they would move from one end of the screen, once they hit that side, they would head in the oppositie direction. Then of course, hit detection between the player's laser beams and the enemy's laser beams, and the "KA-BOOMS" were added. While doing collision detection, I asked myself, "What about when a player shoots the other player?!", then what I thought would be a co-op game, became not only a co-op game but also a competetive game. Soon, I added hit detection if players hit each other. Once those basic mechanics where fully polished, I went onto the UI of the game. Grabbed that funky font that suited my space theme and wrote a short script to display a score when players get a kill against the enemies. And deducted points for shooting at the other player. Health was added to the game after that, where as enemies are a one hit kill. A pause and game over UI was implemented. Following that, a simple Game Manager which acts a singleton was added to manage game pauses, player(s) death, sound manager and game over mechanics. To make the sound manager work, I grabbed a few "pew pew", "KA-BOOM" and button click/tap sounds off a free sound website. After a few iterations of polishing, I decided to make the game playable on tablets. In order to do that, buttons were placed on the screen to show where to tap to move left and right and to shoot. Then a few small changes and additions were made to the player movement scripts to detect taps for the approriate buttons. Finally, I tested it on my tablet to ensure it was playable from start to end and play tested it with others.

                <h5>
                    Space Escape was my first big group project with a game engine like Unity. My role on this project was to handle all GUI related elements in the game.
                    From the splash screen to the main menu to the in-game HUD, to the options menu and keybindings configurations and pause screen.
                    I had to overcome many challenges and obstacles and although I was not able to accomplish everything I had planned, I learnt many new things on how a game operates behind the scenes.
                    My toughest challenge was to find a way to remake my own Input Manager. I had found a solution on GitHub and with a few tweaks, I was able to save and store custom key binding preferences.

                                Me and my teammate wanted to make a 3D shooter for our Unity project, so we decided to make a 3D maze shooter. The player is stuck in a maze where there is no start and finish.
                                Players have 2 objectives - to stay alive against an unlimited horde of zombies and to get the medical supplies then get to the extraction. First, we made the character model on Fuse. 
                                Then we made a couple of zombie models and added animations for all the characters that are being used in the game and plugged it into Unity. Once the main character was able to walk around and shoot, 
                                we focused on making the zombies animate and made an array that holds all the zombie prefabs. Next, a spawner component was made in order to generate the zombies at the spawn point and make them move around 
                                in random orders on a plane surface. While that was being done, the maze was being made using a height map and the Unity terrain object. A nav mesh was added to the maze that interacts with the zombies for them 
                                to roam around on. A detection script was added to the zombies that would make them interact with the player when he comes in their line-of-sight. Once a zombie dies, they would be added back to the array and spawned after a wait time. 
                                The terrain was painted and the objectives were added to the map. A model for the health pickup and ammo pickup were made and exported into Unity then placed around the maze. A particle system was added to the 
                                objectives as flares to show the player where they need to go. Next, a GUI was made to show the health, ammo count and objectives. Lastly, the game manager was made along with the title screen, game scene, pause screen and an 
                                end game and game over screen were made.

            <h2 class="how">How it was made</h2>
                <h5>
                    Tyrant was my first project in Unity. It is suppose to have a Legend of Zelda feel to it. Doing this project alone and being new to Unity was a challenge for me as a lot of it was new to me. 
                    I learnt a lot from making this game as the scope was a bit bigger than I had expected. First, I made the character sprites using Game Character Hub on Steam. And then gathered sprites off the web.
                    Using Tiled, I made the maps and layed out the collisions then used Tiled2Unity to export the tiled map ontop Unity. Then I made the character move by making a movement script and detect collisons once the 
                    character hit a collision box. This is the first time, I have done collisions and using a clamp method to stop the character from getting stuck or messing up its physics properties. After that, I had to make 
                    a script that would do level progression. Once a player collided with a certain object the scene would change, for example: When the player wanted to leave his village which is on a small island, he must walk upto 
                    a boat, once the player is on the boat, the level changes to the city. Next, I scripted basic enemies that would cause damage to the player once they collided. Next, the dungeon was made into 5 rooms that the player 
                    must go through, each room was consists of different obstacles and enemies. The final room was a chamber where the boss battle took place. The player also needed a sword sprite that would need to appear when the attack 
                    button was pressed depending on which direction the character is facing. Also, the player needed to know what he collided with in order to trigger an event or reduce health. When making the health, I wanted to do it in 
                    a way where the player has 3 hearts to begin with an losses a piece of the heart when they get attacked by an enemy or a trap. After trying to implement this kind of method to work with the player and the GUI, I decided 
                    to do a simple health bar. When it came time to submit the project, I made the title screen and an intro screen explaining the story and linking each scene together and a game over screen.

                </h5>

            <h2 class="how">How it was made</h2>
                <h5>
                    When making the first world of Super Mario Bros. 3, me and my group members first got the spritesheet for the characters and the world.
                    Then we imported the sprite sheet into Tiled to make the first 3 three levels, laying out the background, platforms, pipes, enemy spawn locations, 
                    collisions for the platforms, obstacles, enemy spawn locations and collisions that would be set as triggers when a player falls through the gaps 
                    in the game world. Then we used melonJS, a javascript API that works with HTML to show the tiled map. Then, we animated Mario with his idle, walk, run and 
                    crouch animation. Next, the controls for Mario were implemented. Once he was able to walk, part of the team worked on making the different enemy behaviour.
                    The goomba need to walk from one side of the screen and when they reach the end of the platform, they must fall down, same with the green turtles. Stomping 
                    on the goomba will change its state. The turtle must go into its shell once stepped on and should be kicked when Mario collided with the turtle shell from the sides. 
                    The bricks were made destructable once Mario's head collided with the bricks, and coins must come out the coin block with the same action. Once the first few levels were done, 
                    we focused on making the title screen where the curtain comes up then main menu, then player will select 1-player and then level selection. And finally, sound was added.
